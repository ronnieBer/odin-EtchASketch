# PROJECT: ETCH-A-SKETCH

## A Brief Introduction
In this fourth repository from The Odin Project JavaScript Basics curriculum, I will build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch using a \<div\> element and not a \<canvas\> element.


## Learning Goal
- To use my DOM manipulation and Events skills.
- To use Arrays and Loops.
- To understand the CSS Grid and use it in this project.


#### Reflection/Outcome
As I followed the instruction and completed the basic setup of this Etch-A-Sketch project, I decided to go further to make this project look like a drawing or painting app.
